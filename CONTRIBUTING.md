# IMPORTANT: Bootstrap 3 support

[Bootstrap 3 RC1](http://getbootstrap.com/) is now available meaning that as per the
[roadmap](https://github.com/makeusabrew/bootbox/blob/v3.x/README.md#roadmap)
the next major release of Bootbox will be 4.0.0. This will entail a complete rewrite and new
public API and will be out as close to the full Bootstrap 3.0 release as possible. If you wish
to contribute to its development, please ensure you're working on the
[master](https://github.com/makeusabrew/bootbox/tree/master) branch. If you want to
contribute bugfixes to the Bootbox 3.x series (which depend on Bootstrap 2.x) please work on the
[v3.x]([master](https://github.com/makeusabrew/bootbox/tree/v3.x) branch. A
[gist](https://gist.github.com/makeusabrew/6223814) is available as a sketchpad for v4.x ideas.

## Submitting Pull Requests
