# BootboxJS documentation

Hello intrepid explorer! Thank you for checking out the `gh-pages`
documentation branch. Pull requests are just as welcome here as they are for
library itself, so thank you in advance for any contributions.

## Running locally

Since the documentation is static HTML, you should be able to just
open any given file in a web browser. To serve the pages via a lightweight
web server, you can use something like Python's `http.server` module:

`python3 -m http.server 8080`

Where `8080` is a port of your choosing.
