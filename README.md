# Bootbox - Bootstrap powered alert, confirm and flexible dialog boxes

Please see http://bootboxjs.com for full usage instructions, or head over to http://paynedigital.com/bootbox for
the original writeup about the project.

# IMPORTANT

This is a work-in-progress update to Bootbox. I am no JavaScript wizard, so this is likely to be broken more often 
than not. So, if you **need** something that works, stick to the main repo: https://github.com/makeusabrew/bootbox
