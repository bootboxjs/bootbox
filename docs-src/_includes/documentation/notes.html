                        <b>All</b> Bootstrap modals (and therefore Bootbox modals), unlike native alerts, confirms, or prompts,
                        are
                        <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/javascript/#asynchronous-functions-and-transitions">asynchronous</a>; meaning,
                        the events which Bootstrap generates are <b>non-blocking</b> events.

                            Because of this limitation, code that should not be evaluated until a user has dismissed your dialog 
                            must be called within the callback function of the dialog.

                        This is a limitation of the Bootstrap modal plugin, as noted in the
                        <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/modal/#how-it-works">official Bootstrap documentation</a>.
                        While it <em>is</em> functionally possible to trigger multiple modals, custom CSS and/or JavaScript
                        code might be required for each layer of modal to display properly.

                        You can use either plain text or HTML for pretty much any Bootbox option which sets a display aspect of
                        the rendered modal, such as the title, message, and button labels. Bootbox <b>does not</b> sanitize any of
                        these values. Since we use jQuery&apos;s <a href="https://api.jquery.com/html/">.html()</a> function to build
                        the dialog, this is a possible XSS vector. It is <em>your</em> responsibility to sanitize your content.
